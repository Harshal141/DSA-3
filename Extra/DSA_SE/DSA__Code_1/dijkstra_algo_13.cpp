/*
Title: Write a C++ program to implement Single Source Shortest Path problem by using 
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. 

Problem Statement: Tour operator organizes guided bus trips across the Maharashtra. 
Tourists may have different preferences. Tour operator offers a choice from many different 
routes. Every day the bus moves from starting city S to another city F as chosen by client. On 
this way, the tourists can see the sights alongside the route travelled from S to F. Client may 
have preference to choose route. There is a restriction on the routes that the tourists may choose 
from, the bus has to take a short route from S to F or a route having one distance unit longer 
than the minimal distance. Two routes from S to F are considered different if there is at least 
one road from a city A to a city B which is part of one route, but not of the other route.
